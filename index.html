        <h2>What I like to do</h2>        
        <p>I’m a big fan of anything active or competitive—whether it’s watching live sports and cheering on my favorite teams, getting hands-on by playing sports myself, or diving into the world of video games where strategy and quick reflexes rule. I love the energy, challenge, and fun that comes with all of it.</p>

        <h2>My skills</h2>
        <p> I have a strong creative side, especially when it comes to sketching and drawing—it's something I’ve always enjoyed and continually work to improve. I'm also a fast learner who picks up new skills quickly, whether it’s hands-on tasks, creative projects, or learning new technologies. I enjoy challenges and adapt easily to new environments.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p> In just one whirlwind week, I journeyed through three different countries—chasing new cultures, collecting passport stamps, and living out of a backpack with a spirit for adventure. </p>

    <h3> Motto </h3> 
    <p> Don't think just guess, Have good Intentions. I got the first one from my friend in public school and the second one I got from a hoddie I own. </p>
